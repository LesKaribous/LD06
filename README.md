# LD06
Library created by Jonathan QUILLES (Mike118) for the LD06 lidar: https://www.robot-maker.com/shop/capteurs/468-lidar-ld06-468.html
This lidar sends data in a twelve points per packet format but the library provides a function that can tell when a full 360° scan is available and provide all the data for that 360° scan.
You can print full scan data using teleplot (check :https://teleplot.fr/) or in a csv format.
